Now, I've changed my attitude. I decided to go all in and do my best to be a good steward of my popular open-source projects. Fairly consistently, I've been so frustrated with other open-source projects lack of good documentation and support. In the race to be the first to create something of value to the world and provide it for free, code quality and solid documentation are commonly sacrificed. I hate this with a passion. Believe me, I understand why and I empathize. I AM PART OF THE PROBLEM! This needs to change and it starts with me.
