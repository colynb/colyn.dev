I just got out of a Zoom meeting with another developer who contributed to version 3.0 of my serverless-dotenv-plugin and I needed his help to get it merged. I decided to open up a couple hours on Friday's to dedicate to Open Source, what I am calling _Open Hours for Open Source_. I reached out to this dev on Github and sent him my [openhours calendly link](https://calendly.com/infrontlabs/openhours) and much to my surprise, he scheduled an hour with me and it went really well. We got his code merged and we even got to know each other a bit.
